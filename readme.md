Console Animation and Timeout Script
(This goes WAY beyond the brief of what was required but I had extra time)

This Python script provides a simple console-based animation and timeout functionality. It's designed to showcase the use of keyboard input detection and basic text animations. The script is platform-independent and works on both Windows and non-Windows systems.
Features

    Text Animation: The script includes three functions (animate_text, animate_text2, and animate_text3) that display text with a progressive animation effect by clearing the console screen and printing characters with increasing indentation. These functions are customizable and can be used to create visually appealing text animations.

    Timeout Functionality: The wait_for_keypress_or_timeout function allows the script to wait for a keypress within a specified timeout period. If a key is pressed, the script restarts; otherwise, it exits gracefully after the timeout expires. This feature can be useful for creating interactive console applications that require user input within a time limit.

Usage

    Timeout Configuration: You can adjust the timeout_seconds variable at the beginning of the script to set the desired timeout duration in seconds. This determines how long the script will wait for user input.

    Text Animation: The animate_text, animate_text2, and animate_text3 functions can be called with custom text and delay values to create animated text effects. These can be modified or expanded to suit your specific use case.

    Running the Script: Execute the script in a terminal or command prompt. It will display introductory messages, animations, and prompt the user for input within the specified timeout.

Platform Compatibility

The script checks the platform it's running on (Windows or non-Windows) to ensure compatibility. Console clearing commands (cls for Windows and clear for other platforms) are used accordingly.
Dependencies

This script relies on the Python os, time, sys, select, and msvcrt modules for various functionalities. These are standard Python libraries and do not require any additional installation.
Example

An example of how to use this script is provided within the if __name__ == "__main__": block. It demonstrates the sequential execution of introductory messages, text animations, and the timeout feature.
